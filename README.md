1. Update Dataset Path:
   - Replace `data_path` with the path to your new CSV file (local or URL).
     data_path = 'path/to/your/new_dataset.csv'
   - Ensure the CSV has features in all columns except the last, which should contain labels.

2. Adjust Model Input and Output:
   - Update `n_inputs` to match the number of features in the new dataset.
     ```
     n_inputs = dataset.X.shape[1]  # Automatically set to number of features
     ```
   - Modify the output layer in `MLP` to match the number of classes. For example, for 5 classes:
     ```
     self.hidden3 = Linear(8, 5)  # Change 3 to 5
     ```
3. Tune Training Parameters:
   - Adjust `batch_size`, learning rate (`lr`), or number of epochs based on dataset size and complexity.
     ```
     train_dl = DataLoader(train, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)  # Example: larger batch size
     optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)  # Example: smaller learning rate
     for epoch in range(100):  # Example: fewer epochs
     ```
4. Add Device Support (Optional):
   - To support GPU, add device handling:
     ```
     device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
     model = model.to(device)
     inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)
     row = row.to(device)  # For single sample prediction
     ```
